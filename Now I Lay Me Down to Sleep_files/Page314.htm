Lindsey's enthusiasm dimmed slightly and she blinked again. “Around three this morning, I think,” she replied slowly. Instead of continuing to question Lindsey directly, Dr. Melody turned to scan the rest of the group.</span></p>

I made sure not to use electronics for 30 minutes before bed, I made sure the room was dark, and I took a hot shower before I got into bed. But I couldn't get to sleep.” It was the most anyone had heard him say since he'd entered the room, but Dr. Melody seemed to be waiting for a bit more. The silence stretched uncomfortably. The florescent lights above them hummed.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;line-height:

  color:black;language:en-US'>“I have Sleep Apnea. I got diagnosed over Winter break. I just got my CPAP machine, but... I'm afraid to go to sleep because I'm afraid I won't wake up.” There was dead silence in the room. Even the lights stopped making noises. Dawn could feel her face getting hotter and hotter with each heartbeat. The smile had slipped off Lindsey's face, Luc was staring at her, apparently dumbfounded, and even Quinton had looked up from his slouched position. Dr. Melody finally broke the tension.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;line-height:
  20.0pt'><span lang=en-US style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
  color:black;language:en-US'>“Well, Dawn, I don't think you're the only one in this room with that fear, or some variation of it. Am I right?” she asked, again opening her question up to the whole group. Three heads nodded their assent. Dawn smiled weakly; she wasn't alone. Dr. Melody glanced down at her watch.</span></p>

  color:black;language:en-US'>“So, we have about five minutes. I think in light of what we've uncovered her today. we should try our best to tackle this fear first. Fear is a physiological response to a stimulus that our brains have perceived as dangerous, right?” Four heads nodded. “This shared fear, the fear of not waking up, is probably contributing to the insomnia you're all experiencing,” Dr. Melody continued stating the obvious. “But fear is an instinct, and sometimes it is in our best interest to rationalize ourselves through the situation instead of relying on the fear to do it for us. We all have the capability to control our behavior, so we're going to try to reason our way into eradicating this fear. A method that I have personally found very useful is a short mantra I say before I get into bed, to help me believe that I will get to sleep, and that I will wake up in the morning. I want you to use it all tonight as you prepare to go to sleep…”</span></p>
